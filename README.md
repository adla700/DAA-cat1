There is no definitive answer to which optimization algorithm works best for weight optimization of neural networks,
as different algorithms may perform better depending on the specific problem. Ultimately, the best optimization algorithm for a specific problem should be 
chosen based on its performance and efficiency in achieving the desired results.
